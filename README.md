# GCSE Overkill (Python)

**An over-engineered, slightly audacious take on GCSE Computing — specifically Python programming.**

## Purpose
This repo is my personal dojo for revisiting and mastering every core GCSE Computing coding concept.  
It’s partly for my own revision, partly to flex a little — and yes, partly to impress my Head of CS.  

## What You’ll Find
- A bunch of small, focused `.py` scripts demonstrating GCSE-style problems  
- Clean code (but not necessarily industry-standard production code — this is for learning!)  
- Extra topics that go beyond GCSE, because overkill is fun  

## Notes
This is **not** meant to be a perfect textbook or a model of professional software engineering.  
It’s a learning project, a memory palace, and maybe a conversation starter.  

Kind regards,  
*Me — the computing guy at my school with too much free time.*
